## Overview

The **Image Recognition Service** is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for image analysis. It employs advanced deep learning techniques to identify and classify images based on their content. The service is built to scale, meaning it can handle varying loads of image processing without a hitch.

By utilizing AWS's powerful infrastructure, this application benefits from features such as auto-scaling, which allows it to automatically adjust the number of active servers based on demand. This ensures that the service remains responsive even during peak usage times.

## Features

- **Scalable Architecture**: Automatically adjusts resources based on traffic.
- **REST API**: Easy integration with other applications.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms for image recognition.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests to optimize resource use.
- **Secure Storage**: Images are stored in AWS S3 for durability and accessibility.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies to deliver its functionality:

- **AWS**: The backbone of our infrastructure.
- **EC2**: Provides scalable computing capacity.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing for event-driven processes.
- **AWS S3**: Storage for images and data.
- **Elastic Search**: For fast and scalable search capabilities.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **REST API**: Standardized way to interact with the service.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Image Recognition Service**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TNking1/image-recognition-service.git
   cd image-recognition-service
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are configured properly. You can do this by creating a file at `~/.aws/credentials` with the following format:
   ```
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application locally to test it out:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start sending image data to the REST API. You can use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.

### Example Request

To send an image for recognition, use the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/recognize \
-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
-F "image=@path_to_your_image.jpg"
```

### Example Response

The API will return a JSON response containing the predictions:

```json
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "label": "Cat",
      "confidence": 0.98
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. `/api/recognize`

- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Accepts an image file and returns predictions.
- **Request**: Image file as multipart/form-data.
- **Response**: JSON object with predictions.

### 2. `/api/health`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Checks the health of the service.
- **Response**: JSON object indicating service status.

## Deployment

For deployment, you can follow these steps to set up the application on AWS:

1. **Create an EC2 Instance**: Choose an instance type that suits your needs.
2. **Set Up Security Groups**: Ensure that the necessary ports (like 80 and 5000) are open.
3. **Deploy the Application**: Transfer your code to the EC2 instance and run it.
4. **Configure Load Balancer**: Set up an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
5. **Set Up Auto Scaling**: Create an auto-scaling group to manage instances based on load.
